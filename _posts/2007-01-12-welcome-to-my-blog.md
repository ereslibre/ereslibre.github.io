As always, first of all, thanks for visiting my blog. I hope this is the last change I do to my blog address, and I really hope you enjoy it.

Here I will talk about in which parts of KDE project I&#8217;m involved, and explain how the development progress goes on, maybe with some screenshots, and preliminary patches.

Hope you enjoy the blog !
