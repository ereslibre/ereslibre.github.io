We are organizing an aKademy in a national level, called aKademy-es. All the needed information can be found at [this site](http://www.ereslibre.es/akademy-es/).

If you are a developer, artist, usability expert, user&#8230;. you are welcome !! Talks will be in spanish, so if you understand the language, you won&#8217;t have any problem.

Currently we are on the CALL FOR LOCATIONS phase, as well as asking for sponsorship.
