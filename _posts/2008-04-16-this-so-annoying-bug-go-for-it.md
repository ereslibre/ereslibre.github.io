Yeah, 2nd edition of the bugsquashing day. As George has already mentioned, this is the continuation of the first bugsquashing day.

Join us at #kde-bugs on irc.freenode.net (or what is the same, irc.kde.org). You can [visit the techbase page that contains all the information](http://techbase.kde.org/index.php?title=Contribute/Bugsquad/BugDays/KonquerorDay2).

So it&#8217;s your chance for helping out the KDE community and yourself ! If you notice bugs, stop complaining, join us and tell us what&#8217;s wrong ! This is a great way of closing bugs. Konqueror will look much better after it ðŸ™‚

Don&#8217;t think more about it and join us ðŸ™‚
