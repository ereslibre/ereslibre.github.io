On the very previous post I was suggested to create a dot story and poll there people with this question. Well, I don&#8217;t know if this could be a &#8220;dot story&#8221; ðŸ™‚

I guess this time I got to a final approach (on what the &#8220;continuous bar&#8221; is concerned). I added another gradient (vertical) so it doesn&#8217;t look so 90&#8217;s. I used KColorScheme and QPalette to correctly use colors, and it seems I get good results with all the color schemes I have on KDE 4.

Maybe a border to clearly mark where the widget starts and where ends.

Nuno Pinheiro had given me some input on how to draw a nicer approach. This is the one I like most ðŸ™‚ He told me to use a solid color for the capability bar itself, but after trying the green-to-red gradient I just couldn&#8217;t resist to it.

  The widget design is based (really, fast based) <a href="http://media.ereslibre.es/2008/04/progresscontinuous.svg" target="_blank">on the mockup Nuno did tonight for me</a> :). Thank you very much Nuno. I really like the shape this widget is taking. ðŸ™‚
