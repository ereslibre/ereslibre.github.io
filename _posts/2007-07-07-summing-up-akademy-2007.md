This has been my first time at aKademy. I knew that our community was incredible, but my idea right now is even more than that. The way we fit together and the way we just have fun altogether is just incredible.

I am right now at Glasgow airport waiting for my flight for London, where I will stay for a week visiting my brother. Well, I hope I can do some things there with my laptop ![:)][1]

I want to congratulate and give thanks to the organizers, as well as everybody that made this so nice. Guys, I am just waiting for the next aKademy.
