After some quite time pretty busy at work I had the time to hack with some relax. Yesterday I wanted to give one of the final touches to Spokify before it gets to a v1.0 release. To sum up:

*   Now when the track ends it changes to the next track. Not before. [This is a historical problem with the libspotify library which doesn’t provide the exact length of the track][1].
*   Some spotted bugs fixed, specially regarding clicking on the cover to highlight the current track and filtering combo.
*   Previous and Next on the system tray icon.
*   Removed slider handle.
*   Slider now can be clicked to seek on the current track.
*   Creating playlists implemented.
*   Renaming playlists implemented.
*   Deleting playlists implemented.
*   Repeat finally implemented. It was always an enabled thing, now you can choose.
*   Add songs to playlists by drag & drop.

Still to do for release v1.0:

*   Allow to star tracks and list them.
*   Show playlists owners on the playlists view (trivial one).
*   Implement shuffle. Probably trivial, but want to do it right from the start. Still to decide if previous and next should take unordered list into account.
*   Implement cool track switching. Some kind of new widget. Note we never had next and previous buttons on the GUI, this is because of this plan.
*   Allow to set playlists as collaborative (trivial one).

As usual, [I have recorded a video in order to show old and new features][2]:

So, if you are using Spokify and have feedback, please let me know. Arch Linux users have a package ready to be installed: `yaourt -S spokify-git’.
