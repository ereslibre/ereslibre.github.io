So&#8230; finally&#8230; it is a real thing. You can get a laptop with GNU/Linux preinstalled in your usual store. I found [this on the Carrefour site (spanish)](http://www.carrefouronline.carrefour.es/noalimentacion/TemplateProduct.aspx?itemMarcado=catalog310026&navAction=push&navCount=5&menu=no&nivel_desplegado=nivel2_4&itemId=43704698).

It is really nice since you can get a pre installed free software laptop (despite it is not very powerful, and goes in the line of AAA, but extremely portable).

The best thing, is that it comes with a distribution (Linpus), which contains KDE by default. Those computers got out of stock in 1 week. So, here, near to where I live, there are out there some computers with a KDE desktop running and ready to make happy their users ðŸ™‚
