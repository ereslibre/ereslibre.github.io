So I decided to go for all the missing features of the Open/Save dialog, and everything is in SVN now. I have also added support for having filenames below icons or previews (as we had on kde3 too). I have been told several times about this lack of functionality.

Everything works like a charm in KFileWidget/KDirOperator. It is stunning fast and take in count the screencast has been recorded with everything compiled in debug mode (what makes it slightly slower, and sometimes, very slower), but still like a charm.

So, I have played around to show all the functionality of the new features and how to mix them.

PS: I have tried to upload the video to vimeo, but it was hanging somehow. I have seen that I have to convert ogv since they don&#8217;t seem to support it. I am pretty tired today&#8230; so I will update this post tomorrow if I manage to upload the video on vimeo ðŸ˜‰
