It is impossible to don&#8217;t feel when something amazing is happening. I really see what is going on in here&#8230; and is more than amazing, is just stunning.

Take this as an example: the KDE team is growing and growing, year by year. KDE has advanced amazingly from last year on Akademy at Glasgow to nowadays. They are plain different desktops. A much more advanced, stable, comprehensive desktop.

We still have a very long path to go, but we are walking, step by step, without stopping, moving forward. I don&#8217;t want to think about what KDE will be able to do for us on next Akademy.

I want to heavily thank Nokia for their donation to the KDE contributors. I (as I am sure, the rest of the contributors) will work to make KDE be a desktop perfectly usable on small devices.

So, I am really looking forward to a computer-human-oriented paradigm. Where you will be able to click on a file on Dolphin, for instance, and you are told from where you got it, if it was downloaded from somewhere, received by a friend on Kopete, and possible actions to do with that friend (send a IM if connected, write a new mail, send a file&#8230;).

Is great to see you guys another year (this is my second Akademy). I have got very well adapted to this community and amazingly fast, and that is always because of you all guys&#8230; you are doing an amazing work, and the KDE desktop is proving it.

So&#8230; the future is ours. Nothing is stopping us from advancing&#8230; Let&#8217;s keep rocking !! ðŸ˜‰
