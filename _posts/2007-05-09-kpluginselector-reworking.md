This was something Kate developers suggested me (and others). This dialog needed some love. As you can see, I draw &#8220;categories&#8221; here as I do on dolphin, asking for KStyle to do it (so categories here will be drawn exactly as they are on dolphin). If QStyle found instead of KStyle it will fallback for a default drawing. I know, KStyle changes haven&#8217;t been committed yet, and I hope they will, because they give us some advantages (as the one you can see here):

Of course there is some work to do right now, but I want to know what do you think about this preliminar appearance.
