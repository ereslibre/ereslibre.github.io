We all know KControl needs love. I have been hacking on it today for a few hours. What I have right now is what you can see at the screenshot:

</p>

  I plan to add on-hover-items information, so when you hover an item, some information is shown about that item, somewhere.
</p>

<p align="left">
  The idea is that here you have main categories, and then when you click on one of them, another &#8220;wheel&#8221; is shown (in this same dialog), with suboptions, for example in &#8220;Appearance & Themes&#8221; you would have &#8220;Styles&#8221;, &#8220;Colors&#8221; and so on on another wheel. When clicking on that subitem, the actual configuration widget is shown on the same dialog.

  I would like to know what do you think in general of this approach. If you find it easier than the current KControl, and why do you like or you don&#8217;t ðŸ˜‰

  Please if you usually are on IRC, just ping me (ereslibre) if you have suggestions or something. You can also contact me through e-mail (about page shows my email address).
