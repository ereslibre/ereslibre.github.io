I have thought for a while on a nice approach for KCategorizedView when selecting elements. Making categories look as &#8220;selected&#8221; if all items inside it were selected. It doesn&#8217;t matter if they had been selected by clicking on the category or just by selecting them individually or by a rectangle or whatever.

[Here is the small screencast showing the behavior](http://media.ereslibre.es/2007/09/categoriesSelected.ogg).

I would like to know what do you think of this approach, and if you prefer this one or the older.
