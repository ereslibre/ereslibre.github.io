I have thought for a while on a nice approach for KCategorizedView when selecting elements. Making categories look as “selected” if all items inside it were selected. It doesn’t matter if they had been selected by clicking on the category or just by selecting them individually or by a rectangle or whatever.

[Here is the small screencast showing the behavior][1].

I would like to know what do you think of this approach, and if you prefer this one or the older.
