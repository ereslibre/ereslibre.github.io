Yes&#8230; finally this is a usable version of KListView. I think to commit all this work very soon. I am really glad to show you a video in which you can find out that KListView is almost ready for being used. After having all features working perfectly, I will concentrate on making it faster.

As always, I will appreciate your comments and of course, hope you like it. [Click here to download the new video](http://media.ereslibre.es/2007/06/klistviewselections3.mpeg).
