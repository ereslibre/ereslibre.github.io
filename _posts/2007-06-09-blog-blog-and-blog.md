First of all, thanks for ask me to blog on my advances. I particularly want to blog about this very small improvement from the last video I posted yesterday, but I really think yellow.submarine had a neat idea. I never (and nobody) told me before to select items by clicking on their categories, and I find it very fast and straight-forward on a click-away, instead of dragging your mouse to get all those items.

What&#8217;s more, [as shown on the new video](http://media.ereslibre.es/2007/06/klistviewselections2.mpeg), you won&#8217;t lose the ability to select items starting on categories (it won&#8217;t confuse your drag-start with a click), so we do not lose any usability hint.

Now that I have time, and I&#8217;m concentrated on KListView I hope to go fast on this one :), and I hope it to be fast too ðŸ™‚
