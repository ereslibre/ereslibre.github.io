First of all, thanks for ask me to blog on my advances. I particularly want to blog about this very small improvement from the last video I posted yesterday, but I really think yellow.submarine had a neat idea. I never (and nobody) told me before to select items by clicking on their categories, and I find it very fast and straight-forward on a click-away, instead of dragging your mouse to get all those items.

What’s more, [as shown on the new video][1], you won’t lose the ability to select items starting on categories (it won’t confuse your drag-start with a click), so we do not lose any usability hint.

Now that I have time, and I’m concentrated on KListView I hope to go fast on this one ![:)][2] , and I hope it to be fast too ![:)][2]
