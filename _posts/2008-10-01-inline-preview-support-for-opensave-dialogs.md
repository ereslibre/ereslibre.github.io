After some time hidden in the dark “fixing bugs” cave, I got out to work on a new feature for Open/Save dialogs. Actually, is somehow a fix-regression. I am working on it to correctly support inline previews. After the KFileWidgetPreviewGenerator code has been moved to kdelibs, it is a pleasure to work on this thing.

I also have hacked out a way to customize the icon size of the views, which I think feels pretty handy.
