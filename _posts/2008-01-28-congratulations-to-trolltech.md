I hope this acquirement from Nokia will improve and speed up the progress of Qt (well, it was amazing with Trolltech anyway). I really hope Nokia will understand what a huge open source community is behind Qt/KDE and act in purpose.

We, as developers help improve the toolkit, as well as users we get the benefits from it being open.

Anyway, I am pretty confident everything is going to be allright, and amazing times are coming for Qt.

**Congratulations Trolltech for your strong support and great work !**
