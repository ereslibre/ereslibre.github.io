So yesterday I arrived to Guademy (at Coru√±a, Spain). I had no time to write about it yesterday because it was a very nice social day. Meeting some KDE and Gnome devs.

The receivement was really nice and organization did a great work.

Today is when the schedule starts, and more people is coming.
