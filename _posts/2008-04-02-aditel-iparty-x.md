Time to blog about the iParty the KDE community in Spain went to this weekend. I was there from thursday to sunday, and I only have amazing words for them. Everything, absolutely everything was perfect. It has been the place where I have felt so warm with the rest of the community, the organization and the event itself. Amazingly organized, probably from organizing it 9 times before. And if everything was perfect, at some point they turn off the lights and start to sing “happy birthday” because of mine while bringing a chocolate-cake… I ended up with no words.
