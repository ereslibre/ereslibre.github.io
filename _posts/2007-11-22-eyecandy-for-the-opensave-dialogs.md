Yesterday I just wanted to give a bit more eyecandy for the open/save dialogs. Today I&#8217;m going to review the patch and give probably a fade out effect for items, as well as fast transitions when you hover another item while a previous transition effect is still running.

What I got yesterday <a href="http://media.ereslibre.es/2007/11/smoothpreview.mpeg" target="_blank">can be grabbed from here as a video</a>, and as usually, <a href="http://media.ereslibre.es/2007/11/smoothPreview.diff" target="_blank">you can find the patch (and apply it on kdelibs) here</a>.
