Yesterday I just wanted to give a bit more eyecandy for the open/save dialogs. Today Iâ€™m going to review the patch and give probably a fade out effect for items, as well as fast transitions when you hover another item while a previous transition effect is still running.

What I got yesterday [can be grabbed from here as a video][1], and as usually, [you can find the patch (and apply it on kdelibs) here][2].
