I have been working a bit with KStyle, to know how it works, and how I should manage it from KListView. I would like it to provide 2 things to KListView: 1. Categories drawing (background), 2. Item joining.

I have the first one done. I still have to polish it, but it works all right. [I have recorded a video][1] (ogg format). Because of its large size, I can’t afford to have it on my server, so I uploaded it to ruphy’s web space… thanks Riccardo !!
