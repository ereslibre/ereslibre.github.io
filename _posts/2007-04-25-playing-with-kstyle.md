I have been working a bit with KStyle, to know how it works, and how I should manage it from KListView. I would like it to provide 2 things to KListView: 1. Categories drawing (background), 2. Item joining.

I have the first one done. I still have to polish it, but it works all right. <a href="http://media.ereslibre.es/2007/04/categorization.ogg" target="_blank">I have recorded a video</a> (ogg format). Because of its large size, I can&#8217;t afford to have it on my server, so I uploaded it to ruphy&#8217;s web space&#8230; thanks Riccardo !!

Is all for now&#8230; I will come back when have more news ðŸ™‚
