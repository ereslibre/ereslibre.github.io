KDE SC has improved a lot. It was already a really good piece of software, but it is getting a real boost lately and things are progressing exponentially. Good times.

As a wise teacher once told us: _limits exist only in our imagination_. So, now is time to break limits. All of them. To sum up my work on free software, this is what will receive lots of love from now on:

  * <a href="http://www.kde.org" target="_blank">KDE SC</a>: some fixes that I have to introduce. For example: support for RTL layouts in KCategorizedView that was missing because of the hard refactor done there. Also, KPluginSelector will need a review on that endless loop. Big bluetooth support, and lots, lots of things to come.
  * <a href="http://qt.nokia.com" target="_blank">Qt</a>: spare ideas on spare places. QList is on the aim. Something performance related. Can&#8217;t tell much yet though.
  * <a href="http://git.ereslibre.es/spokify" target="_blank">Spokify</a>: finish what I started here. Make it feature complete (allowing drag and drop). Will need to revisit libraries to implement all kind of goodies they introduced on social networks and all that.
  * <a href="http://www.ereslibre.es/projects/bb" target="_blank">BugBuster</a>: a distributed bug tracking system. I started this project with lots of hopes of it being really useful, and it needs to be completed to the point of being usable as a real bug tracking system. Basically my aim is to make it as feature complete as BugZilla. High goals. Possibly a script to convert BugZilla databases to BugBuster.
  * <a href="http://www.ereslibre.es/projects/ideal" target="_blank">Ideal Library</a>: in my little spare time of all the previous: the library of my dreams. Something similar to Qt, but with advantages provided by nowadays compilers. Basics are there: it now needs to grow.

<a href="http://git.ereslibre.es" target="_blank">Every project</a> is in the plan with the full-hearted hope of making this world a bit better on what I really love. Sometimes I think that most people first study and later finds the reason to move their minds in a determinated direction (or not), something they really love. Probably most of us on this community found this love much before starting studying. Studies took me a bit longer for loving so much this science and the could-not-stop working on unrelated stuff (or what university understands as unrelated). However I feel confident and really happy I found something that moves my heart that fast and makes me feel that good. Good times.

Let&#8217;s forget limits. Let&#8217;s work together. Let&#8217;s make KDE SC rock, thus, helping this world to be a better place for every person living here.
