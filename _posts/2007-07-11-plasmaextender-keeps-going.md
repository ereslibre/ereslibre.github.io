While doing lots of tourism in London I&#8217;m hacking on the Plasma extender. It is really nice to see that right now is more than an idea. I really loved to see this on our plasma desktop. It seems that the basics are being developed without many troubles. Probably a small refactoring is needed, but that can be discussed whenever we want, of course.
