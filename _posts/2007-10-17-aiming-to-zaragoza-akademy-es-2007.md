As you might know, the aKademy-es event will be held on Zaragoza, days 16, 17 and 18, november. The exact place will be “Hispalinux Aragón”.

We are getting a nice number of attendees and nice talks too. I think this event will be very interesting, in both human and technical sides.

As Albert already said: WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU !! If you are not a speaker and want to join us for brainstorming, comments, ideas, just come with us and we can be alltogether ! No registration is needed if you are not presenting a talk ![:)][1] 

You have further details [on this web site][2].
