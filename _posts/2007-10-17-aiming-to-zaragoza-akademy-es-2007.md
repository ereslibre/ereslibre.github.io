I still need to buy my tickets to Zaragoza for attending aKademy-es. I will love to see again those who cares about free software as me, and loves it as me ðŸ™‚

As you might know, the aKademy-es event will be held on Zaragoza, days 16, 17 and 18, november. The exact place will be &#8220;Hispalinux AragÃ³n&#8221;.

We are getting a nice number of attendees and nice talks too. I think this event will be very interesting, in both human and technical sides.

As Albert already said: WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU !! If you are not a speaker and want to join us for brainstorming, comments, ideas, just come with us and we can be alltogether ! No registration is needed if you are not presenting a talk ðŸ™‚

You have further details <a href="http://www.ereslibre.es/akademy-es/" target="_blank">on this web site</a>.
