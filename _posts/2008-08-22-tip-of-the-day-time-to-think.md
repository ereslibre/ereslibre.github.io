I am doing some experiments with non blocker tip-of-the-day, and <a href="http://weblog.obso1337.org/" target="_blank">Celeste</a> did bring up a nice suggestion. If the application could show some messages the way the tip-of-the-day redesign I&#8217;m doing. We could say that would be in the way of how Firefox 3 asks you for storing a password when filling out a form.

My idea was to only redesign tip of the day, but it seems that doing a more general way of adding another kind of information will be nice. I will think about it ðŸ™‚

By the way, this is how KTip now is looking here locally (it has a forced string, it is not reading the tip database yet, but that will be easy):

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  So, the most important thing here is that tip of the day is not a blocker dialog that forces you to read that dialog or do whatever you wanted to do with the application. This way you can &#8216;in parallel&#8217; read tips while you can do what you were going to do with the app.

  Generalizing this way of notifying user about certain things, quoting Celeste: &#8216;non-intrusive&#8217; notifications might be nice&#8230; so just wait for news ðŸ™‚
