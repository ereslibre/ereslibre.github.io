Hoping this effort makes most of the people be more happy with how this is going… I have adapted the KCapacityBar to be capable of drawing as shown here, what I think is easy to read, and it gives a very fast idea about how full the device is. Mandatory screenshot:

Since I am very cautious about getting crap into my hard disk (:P), I have forced the capacity bar to the max value, so you can see how it is drawn (and how text is readable).

So… as you know, ideas, comments and suggestions are always very welcome ![:)][3]
