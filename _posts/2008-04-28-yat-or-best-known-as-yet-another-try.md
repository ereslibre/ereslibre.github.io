Hoping this effort makes most of the people be more happy with how this is going&#8230; I have adapted the KCapacityBar to be capable of drawing as shown here, what I think is easy to read, and it gives a very fast idea about how full the device is. Mandatory screenshot:

Since I am very cautious about getting crap into my hard disk (:P), I have forced the capacity bar to the max value, so you can see how it is drawn (and how text is readable).

So&#8230; as you know, ideas, comments and suggestions are always very welcome ðŸ™‚
