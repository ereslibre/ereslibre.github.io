For some random reason I downloaded Last.fm client code (it is a Qt application). What is my surprise when I arrive to the about dialog (don’t ask me why), and read:

> new QShortcut( QKeySequence( Qt::Key\_M, Qt::Key\_L, Qt::Key_I ), this, SLOT(onEasterEgg()) );

As I wanted to keep the magic, I didn’t look to onEasterEgg slot, and run to press M L I on my application. I was waiting to something like a nice pang game or whatever, but found something different… also funny ![:)][1]

We all know for example Mozilla Firefox has on the latest version some other winks too. This is not only a closed source feature ! ![:)][1] 

And, of course…
