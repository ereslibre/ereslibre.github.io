For some random reason I downloaded Last.fm client code (it is a Qt application). What is my surprise when I arrive to the about dialog (don&#8217;t ask me why), and read:

> new QShortcut( QKeySequence( Qt::Key\_M, Qt::Key\_L, Qt::Key_I ), this, SLOT(onEasterEgg()) );

As I wanted to keep the magic, I didn&#8217;t look to onEasterEgg slot, and run to press M + L + I on my application. I was waiting to something like a nice pang game or whatever, but found something different&#8230; also funny ðŸ™‚

We all know for example Mozilla Firefox has on the latest version some other winks too. This is not only a closed source feature ! ðŸ™‚

And, of course&#8230;
