Despite the fact that I use Gentoo GNU/Linux operating system for my desktop PC, my laptop doesn&#8217;t would like to burn someday. I have been searching a really easy GNU/Linux distribution for my laptop, and really trying out the current state of the GNU/Linux desktop for normal users. I was just looking for a distribution that detected all my laptop hardware automatically and let me connect to my WPA secured wireless connection. I just wanted everything working without the need of running any command or reading any wiki or forum (just what a normal user would do).

I gave my first try to Kubuntu. For my surprising, from graphical configuring tools, it only lets you add WEP protected wireless connections, what is not enough, I think.

OpenSuSE had merits. I really liked the way the installation was handled (really nice work SuSE team). I found a bit descentralized the way repositories are handled. Let me explain: you have to read a wiki where repositories depends on the OpenSuSE version you have right now (for example 10.2), and then add them. They added a really nice new kde menu. It handled properly my WPA wireless connection.

So I wanted to give a try PC Linux OS. I have to admit I&#8217;m impressed. This was like a dream. It has a really nice appearance (very redmond-like, but is nice for me) at a first look, and the installation can be handled by a kid. Is very intuitive and does exactly what you should expect it to do. It comes by default with KDE, so more points to it. It has a very easy control-center like for managing configurations and so on (YaST like tool). It seems it has all KDE splitted, what is pretty nice for installing only what you want. Anyway, I&#8217;m missing Kile. It seems it is not on the &#8220;official&#8221; repositories.

So as I said before&#8230; despite the fact I use Gentoo on my desktop PC (pretty stable, but I could die by heart-attack if someday my computer breaks): too much work and time on it (mostly when installing first time). So for laptops it seems there are many distributions that do really well.

I like to experiment with this kind of things, so if you want to suggest me your chosen distribution just tell me, and I can give it a try ðŸ™‚
