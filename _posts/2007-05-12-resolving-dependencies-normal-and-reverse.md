KPluginSelector is almost finished. It will save configuration for each plugin when changed, it will let you ask for default options for each plugin, and it will resolve dependencies between plugins, normal and reverse.

The only thing remaining is to make it save which plugins are enabled and which not. After that I will have to polish all the code, and see what can be improved, but it will be ready to be used.
