If you remember the bug I found on the Editor/Delegate part of Qt (version 4.2.2), you will recall I wrote trolls about the strange issue, and I gave them the test application that demonstrated the bug, and a patch I could write in order to fix the bug (at least it didn&#8217;t affected any other things on an overview).

Trolltech is now working on the fixing, as they have informed me. If you are interested to track this bug you can fly to:

<span class="q"></span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.trolltech.com/developer/tasktracker.html" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">http://www.trolltech.com/developer/tasktracker.html</a>

and ask for task 146292.

I&#8217;m glad Trolltech professionals are so effective. They told me the fix is probably being released with Qt 4.3.
