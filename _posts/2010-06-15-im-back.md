This year has been amazingly busy. I had some subjects (9, to say) that required lots, and I mean **lots** of laboratory time to get done, and finally I got over them pretty successfully. The good thing: they didn&#8217;t had exam. The bad thing: until the end they take your time out to study subjects that have final exams.

So after last exams this week (still one to go, next week), I&#8217;m really glad to be back with this maravelous community. I am strength-full to work like never before.

I am now working on Artesanos del Software, and I am really glad I have been given green-light to work on Qt/KDE SC. This is also great since I&#8217;ll be working as a scholar for almost three months in order to get lots of hours done and get them recognized by the University as working hours.

So my really full-hearted wish is to work hard in KDE SC and do everything that is possible from my side.

PS: I am really sad I won&#8217;t be able to attend Akademy this year. I have to defend my &#8220;final project&#8221; career (which takes one year) in july, and guess what, there is no concrete date set: between 5th &#8211; 10th july, so that is a huge window time to book tickets / accommodation.
