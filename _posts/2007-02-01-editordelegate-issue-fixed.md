I just want to inform you that Trolltech closed task number 146292 that you can check out <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/developer/tasktracker.html" target="_blank">here</a>. The task was closed on the 23rd of January, and opened on the 11th of January, set from the beginning to Priority 2. It will come with Qt 4.3 release as Trolltech planned. So the bug fixing has been quite fast.

Is really great to see the excellent work of the Trolltech team. Keep working as you do.

Thank you Trolltech !
