It seems <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guademy.org/index.php?lang=en">Guademy</a> is finally here. I am going to have the pleasure to meet some KDE folks as Aaron, Albert Astals, Antonio Larrosa as far as I know, and a lot of people that aims to get a better desktop in general, doesn&#8217;t matter if on KDE or Gnome project.

This is the first time that I go to a free software event, and I&#8217;m giving a talk about the kuiserver, how it works, and what can it do right now.

There are lots of interesting talks, and I hope I will be able to go to every one !

You can bet I will blog (if my ipw2200-firmware lets me do it with wpa_supplicant) each day of the event. If it is not possible I will sum up my impressions and what I lived when coming back home. I think this will be really productive and fun.
