What to do when something is not as good as expected (or as intuitive as expected) ? Well, you drop it. That is what I’ve done with the way the plugin selector handles the Configurations dialog & the about dialog. Now they are separate buttons. It didn’t make so much sense when having configuration dialogs putting instead of “About”, “Options” and adding there the about information of the plugin. Mandatory screenshot:
