While hacking on KDE, fixing bugs as if world was going to end tomorrow, watching football (soccer) matches and talking on IRC, one could have read this on a random day like today:

```
[00:07] <DxSadEagle> ereslibre_laptop: I often don't remember what I was planning to do 5 minutes ago, but may remember obscure stuff from 3 years ago
...
[00:08] <DxSadEagle> ereslibre_laptop: dude, sorry, I can't talk. I want to start on something before I forget what it is
```

Good to see I am not the only one who has this kind of trouble with memory =) Anyway, thanks KHTML team for making this engine so amazingly powerful.
