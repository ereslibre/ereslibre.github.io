Not a new shiny feature, not a really cool new application&#8230; from my point of view a really needed bugfix. Yesterday I committed a patch that is supposed to fix all (at least, almost all) toolbars problems.

I committed it on trunk (4.2), and we have to see if it can be backported (it adds a new static to KGlobal)&#8230; but yes&#8230; they are going the right way&#8230; ðŸ™‚
