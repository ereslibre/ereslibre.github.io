Not a new shiny feature, not a really cool new application… from my point of view a really needed bugfix. Yesterday I committed a patch that is supposed to fix all (at least, almost all) toolbars problems.

I committed it on trunk (4.2), and we have to see if it can be backported (it adds a new static to KGlobal)… but yes… they are going the right way… ![:)][1]
