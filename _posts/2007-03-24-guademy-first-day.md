First day has been really interesting. We have had some talks as QtJambi, PyQt and my talk about kuiserver in the KDE/Qt part, and other interesting talks about Gnome/GTK guys as compiling Gnome from SVN, desktop accessibility, translating gnome, GTK+ programming, multithreading programming with GTK.

We have been kidding all the day long, and after all talks finished (mine was last) we went partying till pretty late.

We have another really interesting schedule today, let&#8217;s see.
