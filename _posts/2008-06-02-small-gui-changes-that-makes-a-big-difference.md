I started some time ago to use Kontact from KDE 4. I usually feel pretty annoyed when I see list views from KDE 3, but after all one gets used to it. I wanted to port the side bar of Kontact to Qt 4, and this is what I got so far: sorting still missing.

It doesn’t matter I am used to Qt 4, always that I port code, I go like… yeah, Qt 4 rocks.
