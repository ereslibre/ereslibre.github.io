Finally, I have just arrived to Paris from Madrid, through Hendaya. This trip has been pretty long and tiring. So I&#8217;m looking forward for visiting it deeply in the next three days.

We try to go to Brussels, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, (and Lyon or Marsella) too.

Hope your vacations are going really well too ðŸ™‚
